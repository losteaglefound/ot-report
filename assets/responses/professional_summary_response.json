        "content": "Sabrina (chronological age: 10 months) was assessed using multiple standardized pediatric assessment tools to evaluate developmental functioning across cognitive, motor, sensory processing, and adaptive behavior domains. The comprehensive evaluation revealed both areas of emerging strength, including social engagement and learning potential, as well as areas requiring targeted intervention support, particularly in fine motor coordination, attention and focus, communication skills, and behavioral regulation. These areas of need may impact Sabrina's ability to interact with her environment, participate in play activities, and develop appropriate adaptive responses. Based on the assessment findings, occupational therapy services are recommended to address these specific challenges and facilitate Sabrina's developmental progression. A collaborative, family-centered approach involving occupational therapy, speech therapy, and early intervention services will be beneficial in ensuring a holistic developmental trajectory. Regular monitoring and reassessment will be crucial to track progress, inform necessary adjustments to the intervention plan, and ensure Sabrina continues to make strides towards her developmental milestones. With active family involvement and education, Sabrina is expected to benefit significantly from such services, enhancing her functional skills and improving her adaptive behaviors."
