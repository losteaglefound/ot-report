        "content": "Sabrina (chronological age: 10 months) was assessed using multiple standardized pediatric assessment tools to evaluate developmental functioning across cognitive, motor, sensory processing, and adaptive behavior domains effectively. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrated strengths in emerging developmental skills, social engagement, and learning potential, highlighting Sabrina's capability to progress within normative developmental ranges with appropriate support. However, notable areas requiring intervention include fine motor coordination, attention and focus, communication skills, and behavioral regulation, which may impact her functional performance and daily activities. Based on these findings, a multidisciplinary intervention approach, incorporating occupational therapy, speech therapy, and family education, is recommended to facilitate developmental milestones and enhance Sabrina's functional capacities. Sabrina is expected to benefit significantly from these services, and her prognosis for achieving developmental goals with active engagement in therapy is favorable. Family involvement and education will play a pivotal role in reinforcing intervention strategies at home. Regular monitoring and reassessment will be essential to track Sabrina's progress and adapt intervention strategies, ensuring sustained developmental success and functional independence. This assessment provides a foundation for developing an individualized intervention plan tailored to Sabrina's specific needs and potential."
