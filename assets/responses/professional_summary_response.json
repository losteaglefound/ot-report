        "content": "Sabrina (chronological age: -1 months) was assessed using multiple standardized pediatric assessment tools to evaluate developmental functioning across cognitive, communication, motor, social-emotional, and sensory processing domains. The comprehensive evaluation revealed both areas of strength and areas requiring targeted intervention support. Notably, Sabrina demonstrated strengths in gross motor skills and social-emotional functioning, performing significantly above expected developmental levels within these domains. Conversely, delays were noted in cognitive abilities, receptive and expressive communication, and fine motor skills, with performance primarily within the 9th-24th percentile, indicating below-average functioning. These delays may impact Sabrina's ability to engage fully in problem-solving, social communication, and self-care tasks. Based on the assessment findings, a multidisciplinary intervention approach is recommended, incorporating occupational therapy and speech-language services to address identified areas of need and promote developmental progression. Family involvement and education will be essential to support Sabrina's learning and development within the home environment. Regular monitoring and reassessment will be crucial to track progress and adjust intervention strategies as needed to ensure Sabrina achieves developmental milestones and functional independence."
