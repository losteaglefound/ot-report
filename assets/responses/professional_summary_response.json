        "content": "Sabrina (chronological age: 10 months) was assessed using multiple standardized pediatric assessment tools to evaluate developmental functioning across cognitive, motor, sensory processing, and language domains. The comprehensive evaluation revealed both areas of emerging strength, such as social engagement and learning potential, and areas requiring targeted intervention support, including fine motor coordination, attention and focus, communication skills, and behavioral regulation. These developmental challenges are impacting her functional performance and daily activities, particularly in relation to engaging with play and early communication. Based on the assessment findings, occupational therapy services are recommended to address these specific areas of need and support Sabrina's optimal developmental progression. A multidisciplinary, family-centered approach involving occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral interventions will be beneficial to address her comprehensive developmental needs effectively. Regular monitoring and reassessment will be important to track progress and adjust intervention strategies as needed to promote functional independence and developmental success. Empowering the family through education and active involvement in the therapeutic process will be crucial in driving positive outcomes. This assessment provides a foundation for developing an individualized intervention plan tailored to optimize Sabrina's potential and enhance her quality of life."
