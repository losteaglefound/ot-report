        "content": "Sabrina (chronological age: 10 months) was assessed using multiple standardized pediatric assessment tools to evaluate developmental functioning across cognitive, motor, sensory processing, and adaptive behavior domains. The comprehensive evaluation revealed both areas of emerging strength, such as potential for learning and social engagement, and areas requiring targeted intervention support, including fine motor coordination, attention, focus, and communication skills. These delays impact Sabrina's functional performance and daily activities, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary intervention approach. Based on the assessment findings, occupational therapy services are recommended to address these needs and support optimal developmental progression. A collaborative, family-centered approach involving therapy services will be beneficial to address Sabrina's comprehensive developmental needs, with particular emphasis on family involvement and education. Regular monitoring and reassessment will be important to track progress and adjust intervention strategies as needed to promote functional independence and developmental success. This assessment provides a foundation for developing an individualized intervention plan that will support Sabrina's growth and development in a structured and evidence-based manner."
