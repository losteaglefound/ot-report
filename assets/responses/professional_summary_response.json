        "content": "Sabrina (chronological age: 10 months) was assessed using multiple standardized pediatric assessment tools to evaluate her developmental functioning across cognitive, motor, sensory processing, and adaptive behavior domains. The comprehensive evaluation revealed both emerging strengths, such as engagement in social interactions and notable learning potential, and areas requiring intervention support, including fine motor coordination, attention and focus, communication skills, and behavioral regulation. These challenges impact her functional performance in daily activities, necessitating a comprehensive, multidisciplinary intervention approach. It is recommended that occupational therapy services be initiated to address these needs. Additionally, the inclusion of speech-language therapy and possible family support services will likely be beneficial. Sabrina is anticipated to benefit significantly from these services given her capacity for learning, and her prognosis for improvement with continued intervention is positive. Active involvement of Sabrina's family, through education and participation in therapeutic activities, is pivotal in enhancing outcomes. Regular monitoring and reassessment will be essential to track her developmental progress and refine therapy goals over time. This assessment provides a foundation for developing a personalized intervention plan that supports Sabrina in achieving her developmental milestones."
