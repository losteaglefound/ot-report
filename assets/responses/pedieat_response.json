    "assessment_description": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The PediEAT assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing abilities across four key domains: Physiology, Processing, Behavior, and Selectivity. This comprehensive assessment provides insight into feeding safety, efficiency, and participation."
    },
    "physiology_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Physiology domain assessment revealed deficits in oral motor skills, including limited tongue lateralization and reduced labial closure. Swallowing safety is compromised with indications of premature spillage and delayed swallow initiation. These findings indicate an elevated risk for aspiration, necessitating further monitoring during feeding activities."
    },
    "processing_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Processing domain evaluation demonstrated limited texture acceptance, particularly with mixed textures, and difficulty with sensory processing of new foods, requiring extended periods for acceptance. The child's ability to process various food textures and consistencies shows an active struggle with finely chopped or lumpy textures, impacting nutritional variety."
    },
    "behavior_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Behavior domain analysis indicated frequent disruptive mealtime behaviors, such as food refusal and difficulty maintaining attention. The child exhibits heightened sensitivity to environmental changes, indicating a need for structured behavioral interventions to enhance feeding compliance and participation."
    },
    "selectivity_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Selectivity assessment revealed a strong preference for carbohydrate-based foods with limited acceptance of proteins and vegetables. The degree of food selectivity demonstrates significant limitations in dietary variety, which adversely impacts nutritional adequacy and requires targeted interventions to broaden the food repertoire."

    "safety_considerations": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Based on the PediEAT findings, feeding safety considerations include a recommendation for supervised feeding sessions to mitigate aspiration risk. Introduction of controlled bolus sizes and pacing strategies is advised. Regular reassessment of feeding skills and safety is recommended to ensure optimal nutrition and prevent feeding-related complications."
