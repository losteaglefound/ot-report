    "assessment_description": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The PediEAT assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing abilities across four key domains: Physiology, Processing, Behavior, and Selectivity. This comprehensive assessment provides insight into feeding safety, efficiency, and participation."
    },
    "physiology_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Physiology domain assessment revealed challenges in oral motor coordination and reduced bolus control, impacting swallowing safety. There is a noted mild aspiration risk during thin liquid intake, requiring vigilance. These findings indicate a need for targeted oral motor interventions to enhance feeding safety and prevent aspiration."
    },
    "processing_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Processing domain evaluation demonstrated limited acceptance of solid textures and hypersensitivity to certain food consistencies, indicating sensory processing difficulties. The child's ability to process various food textures is partially developed, necessitating gradual exposure to diverse textures alongside sensory integration techniques."
    },
    "behavior_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Behavior domain analysis indicated frequent refusal of new foods and prolonged mealtime duration, suggesting anxiety and negative mealtime behaviors. These patterns imply that behavioral interventions focusing on positive mealtime interactions will be beneficial."
    },
    "selectivity_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Selectivity assessment revealed a preference for smooth purees and aversion to mixed textures, limiting dietary variety and posing a risk to nutritional adequacy. The degree of food selectivity impacts feeding development, requiring nutritional interventions to ensure dietary balance."

    "safety_considerations": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Based on the PediEAT findings, feeding safety considerations include consistent monitoring for signs of aspiration, especially with liquids, and adjustments in feeding techniques to mitigate risks. Regular reassessment of feeding skills and safety is recommended to ensure optimal nutrition and prevent feeding-related complications."
