    "assessment_description": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The PediEAT assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing abilities across four key domains: Physiology, Processing, Behavior, and Selectivity. This comprehensive assessment provides insight into feeding safety, efficiency, and participation."
    },
    "physiology_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Physiology domain assessment revealed adequate oral motor skills with notable challenges in achieving efficient lip closure and tongue mobility. Swallowing safety was compromised with occasional coughing episodes post-swallow, indicating a potential risk for aspiration. These findings indicate a need for interventions to enhance oral motor coordination and ensure safer swallowing mechanisms."
    },
    "processing_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Processing domain evaluation demonstrated limited texture acceptance, with the child favoring pureed and semi-solid foods. Sensory processing issues were observed, as evidenced by aversive reactions to textured and lumpy foods. Adaptive feeding skills, such as utensil use, were emerging but inconsistent. The child's ability to process various food textures and consistencies suggests a significant need for tactile and oral sensory integration strategies."
    },
    "behavior_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Behavior domain analysis indicated mealtime challenges such as distractions and refusal behaviors during feeding. Short attention spans and resistive behaviors were noted during exposure to new food items. These patterns suggest the need for structured mealtime routines and positive reinforcement strategies to improve feeding engagement."
    },
    "selectivity_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Selectivity assessment revealed a narrow range of accepted foods, primarily consisting of carbohydrate-rich and bland items. Strong preferences for specific brands and food textures were noted, impacting the child's overall nutritional variety and intake. The degree of food selectivity demonstrates a potential risk for inadequate nutrient intake and necessitates broadening dietary exposure."

Regular reassessment of feeding skills and safety is recommended to ensure optimal nutrition and prevent feeding-related complications."
