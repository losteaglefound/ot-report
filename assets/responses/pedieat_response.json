    "assessment_description": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The PediEAT assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing abilities across four key domains: Physiology, Processing, Behavior, and Selectivity. This comprehensive assessment provides insight into feeding safety, efficiency, and participation."
    },
    "physiology_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Physiology domain assessment revealed decreased oral motor control and discoordinated swallowing patterns, raising potential concerns for aspiration risk during oral intake. These findings indicate a need for targeted intervention to enhance oral motor proficiency and ensure swallowing safety."
    },
    "processing_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Processing domain evaluation demonstrated limited acceptance of mixed textures, coupled with delayed sensory processing of certain food consistencies. The child's ability to process various food textures and consistencies shows marked difficulty with texture transitions, suggesting a need for desensitization strategies and adaptive techniques."
    },
    "behavior_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Behavior domain analysis indicated significant mealtime avoidance behaviors and limited attention to feeding tasks. These patterns suggest a behavioral feeding intervention focused on enhancing engagement and decreasing anxiety related to mealtime."
    },
    "selectivity_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Selectivity assessment revealed a strong preference for a narrow range of foods, mostly processed carbohydrates, with substantial resistance to novel foods. The degree of food selectivity demonstrates noticeable limitations that impact nutritional adequacy and require strategic intervention to broaden dietary variety."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Based on the PediEAT findings, feeding safety considerations include close monitoring for signs of aspiration, particularly with liquids and mixed textures. It is recommended to conduct regular reassessments of feeding skills and safety to ensure optimal nutrition and prevent feeding-related complications."
