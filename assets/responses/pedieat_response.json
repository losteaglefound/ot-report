    "assessment_description": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The PediEAT assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing abilities across four key domains: Physiology, Processing, Behavior, and Selectivity. This comprehensive assessment provides insight into feeding safety, efficiency, and participation."
    },
    "physiology_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Physiology domain assessment revealed mild deficits in oral motor control and timing coordination, with occasional coughing observed during liquid intake indicating potential swallowing safety concerns. These findings indicate a moderate risk for aspiration with thin liquids, necessitating careful monitoring and potential modifications to the feeding regime."
    },
    "processing_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Processing domain evaluation demonstrated a tendency towards moderate difficulty in managing mixed textures and complex food consistencies. The child's ability to process various food textures and consistencies shows a preference for uniform textures, suggesting a need for gradual exposure and adaptation to avoid sensory overload."
    },
    "behavior_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Behavior domain analysis indicated inconsistent attention during feeding and occasional food refusal, particularly with novel or textured foods. These patterns suggest the need for intervention focusing on positive reinforcement and structured mealtime routines to improve engagement and compliance."
    },
    "selectivity_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Selectivity assessment revealed a strong preference for bland, smooth foods, with limited variety in fruits and vegetables. The degree of food selectivity demonstrates a potential impact on nutritional adequacy, highlighting the necessity for introducing a broader spectrum of nutrients to support balanced growth."

    "safety_considerations": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Based on the PediEAT findings, feeding safety considerations include recommending thickened liquids to minimize aspiration risk, alongside continuous monitoring of swallowing function during meals. Regular reassessment of feeding skills and safety is recommended to ensure optimal nutrition and prevent feeding-related complications."
