    "assessment_description": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The PediEAT assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing abilities across four key domains: Physiology, Processing, Behavior, and Selectivity. This comprehensive assessment provides insight into feeding safety, efficiency, and participation."
    },
    "physiology_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Physiology domain assessment revealed moderate challenges with oral motor control, including decreased tongue lateralization and reduced lip closure, contributing to mild dysphagia with thin liquids. These findings indicate a heightened risk for penetration and aspiration, necessitating targeted intervention for safe swallowing."
    },
    "processing_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Processing domain evaluation demonstrated limited acceptance of mixed textures, indicating sensory processing challenges that affect the child's ability to handle multiple food consistencies. The child's ability to process various food textures is below the expected age level, suggesting the need for enhanced desensitization and exposure strategies."
    },
    "behavior_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Behavior domain analysis indicated frequent mealtime tantrums and distraction, alongside prolonged feeding durations. These patterns suggest that behavioral intervention strategies are warranted to improve focus and reduce negative associations with mealtime."
    },
    "selectivity_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Selectivity assessment revealed a narrow range of accepted foods, primarily consisting of carbohydrates, with minimal variety in protein sources or vegetables. The degree of food selectivity demonstrates a significant impact on nutritional adequacy, requiring interventions focused on expanding the diet variety to support balanced nutrition."

    "safety_considerations": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Based on the PediEAT findings, feeding safety considerations include monitoring for signs of aspiration, especially with liquids, and regular reassessment of feeding skills to tailor intervention approaches. Regular follow-up is essential to ensure optimal nutrition and mitigate any potential feeding-related complications."
