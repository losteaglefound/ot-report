    "assessment_description": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The PediEAT assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing abilities across four key domains: Physiology, Processing, Behavior, and Selectivity. This comprehensive assessment provides insight into feeding safety, efficiency, and participation."
    },
    "physiology_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Physiology domain assessment revealed suboptimal oral motor coordination with mild hypersensitivity, impairing effective bolus formation and transit. Swallowing safety was compromised by occasional penetration, highlighting increased vigilance during mealtime for aspiration risk. These findings indicate a need for ongoing monitoring to enhance feeding safety."
    },
    "processing_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Processing domain evaluation demonstrated limited texture acceptance, with the child tolerating only smooth purees and some soft solids. Sensory processing of foods showed aversion to mixed textures, suggesting hypersensitivity. The child's adaptive feeding skills are underdeveloped, requiring support to advance texture acceptance and improve functional feeding capacity."
    },
    "behavior_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Behavior domain analysis indicated food refusals, prolonged mealtime durations, and distractibility during feeding. These patterns suggest that behavioral interventions could facilitate improved focus and cooperation at mealtimes, impacting feeding session duration and efficiency positively."
    },
    "selectivity_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Selectivity assessment revealed a strong preference for a limited range of flavors and brands, with scant acceptance of new or unfamiliar foods. The degree of food selectivity demonstrates a significant impact on nutritional adequacy, warranting focused intervention to broaden dietary variety and ensure comprehensive nutritional intake."

    "safety_considerations": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Based on the PediEAT findings, feeding safety considerations include monitoring for signs of aspiration, particularly with thin liquids and mixed textures. Structured feeding protocols and caregiver training in safe feeding techniques are essential to mitigate risk. Regular reassessment of feeding skills and safety is recommended to ensure optimal nutrition and prevent feeding-related complications."
