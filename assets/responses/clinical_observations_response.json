        "content": "Sabrina participated in an in-clinic evaluation with her mother present. Sabrina presented as generally cheerful and cooperative, though her attention span was markedly limited, necessitating frequent verbal prompts to sustain engagement. Muscle tone appeared within normal limits, and her range of motion was full and functional. Despite this, Sabrina exhibited significant difficulties with distractibility, often needing maximal verbal and visual cues for task completion. Her engagement in structured activities was inconsistent, favoring self-directed play that typically required escalated levels of therapist intervention to maintain task focus. Fine motor coordination deficits were apparent, as Sabrina required hand-over-hand assistance for several tasks, indicative of challenges in visual-motor integration. Behavioral observations during the assessment indicated a propensity for avoidance when tasks became challenging, impacting the validity of standardized testing results and necessitating several procedural modifications to accurately gauge her abilities."
