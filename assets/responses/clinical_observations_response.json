        "content": "Sabrina participated in an in-clinic evaluation with her mother present. Sabrina presented with a cheerful demeanor, demonstrating initial cooperation; however, her attention span was inconsistent, and she exhibited moderate levels of distractibility. Her muscle tone was within typical limits for her age, and she displayed full range of motion in both upper and lower extremities. Sabrina engaged well in self-directed activities but required maximal verbal and visual cues to complete structured tasks, indicating a preference for unstructured play. Her fine motor coordination and visual-motor integration skills were emerging, with observations of Sabrina needing hand-over-hand assistance to successfully complete precision tasks. Throughout the assessment, behavioral observations included occasional outbursts of frustration, necessitating calming strategies to aid in task re-engagement. Frequent redirection and assistance levels impacted the validity of standardized testing outcomes, necessitating adaptive testing protocols to accurately assess her abilities."
