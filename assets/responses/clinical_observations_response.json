        "content": "Sabrina participated in an in-clinic evaluation with her mother present. She demonstrated a cheerful and cooperative demeanor, though variable attention span was noted as a significant factor throughout the assessment. Sabrina's muscle tone was observed to be within normal limits, with no notable limitations in range of motion. However, her engagement patterns were inconsistent, characterized by distractibility and the need for frequent verbal and visual cues to sustain task participation. She displayed more sustained attention during structured activities but required maximal verbal cueing to maintain focus. Fine motor coordination was notably challenged, necessitating hand-over-hand assistance to complete visual-motor integration tasks. These observations necessitated specific testing modifications to ensure the standardized assessment captured her true abilities while providing a supportive testing environment."
