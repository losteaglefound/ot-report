        "content": "Sabrina participated in an in-clinic evaluation with her mother present. She exhibited a cheerful and cooperative demeanor at the onset of the session. Muscle tone and range of motion were within typical limits, indicating no significant orthopedic concerns. Despite a cooperative start, Sabrina's attention span waned over time, with increased distractibility requiring frequent redirection and maximal verbal cues to sustain task engagement. When engaged in structured tasks, she responded more favorably, although still necessitating moderate assistance for task completion. Sabrina demonstrated challenges with fine motor coordination and visual-motor integration, often relying on hand-over-hand assistance to accomplish tasks. These observations necessitated adaptations in standardized testing procedures to derive an accurate representation of her abilities and limitations during the evaluation process."
