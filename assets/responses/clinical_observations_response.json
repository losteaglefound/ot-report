        "content": "Sabrina participated in an in-clinic evaluation with her mother present. She exhibited a generally cheerful and cooperative demeanor at the outset of the session. Observations indicated normal muscle tone and a satisfactory range of motion across all extremities. Sabrina demonstrated a short attention span interspersed with moments of distractibility, necessitating frequent redirection. Despite this, she was able to complete structured activities with maximal verbal and visual cues; during self-directed activities, her engagement waned significantly. Fine motor coordination was inconsistent, requiring hand-over-hand assistance for intricate tasks. Assessment fidelity was impacted, necessitating testing accommodations to sustain her involvement and ensure reliable scoring."
