        "content": "Sabrina participated in an in-clinic evaluation with her mother present. Sabrina presented with a cheerful and cooperative affect while demonstrating intermittent attentional focus throughout the session. Muscle tone and range of motion were observed to be within normal limits for her age, indicating no notable physical constraints. The evaluation highlighted Sabrina's strengths in social-emotional interactions, although she exhibited challenges with distractibility, requiring frequent verbal redirection to sustain task engagement. During structured activities, her performance wavered, necessitating both maximal verbal and visual cues to proceed, alongside moderate hand-over-hand assistance to complete fine motor tasks effectively. In self-directed tasks, her engagement was better sustained, yet discrepancies in visual-motor integration became apparent. Consequently, these observations necessitated adjustments to standardized testing procedures to enhance validity and accuracy of the assessment outcomes."
