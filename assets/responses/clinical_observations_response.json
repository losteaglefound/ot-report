        "content": "Sabrina participated in an in-clinic evaluation with her mother present. Sabrina exhibited a cheerful and cooperative affect, displaying an overall willingness to engage in tasks. However, her attention span was notably limited, characterized by frequent distractibility which necessitated continual verbal redirection. Muscle tone and range of motion were found to be within normal limits, indicating no significant mobility restrictions. During structured activities, Sabrina responded positively to verbal prompting but required maximal visual cues to sustain task engagement, especially during challenging activities. Transitional moments between tasks presented challenges, requiring additional support and cues for successful participation. Fine motor coordination was found to be underdeveloped, evidenced by difficulty with visual-motor integration tasks, thereby necessitating hand-over-hand assistance. These observations suggest potential impacts on the validity of standardized test results, indicating that testing modifications were crucial in maintaining accurate assessment procedures."
