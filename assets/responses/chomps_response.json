    "domain_analysis": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Analysis of ChOMPS domains revealed a moderate level of concern regarding feeding safety and efficiency. The assessment identified difficulties in bolus control and occasional gagging in the oral-motor domain that require intervention attention."

    "feeding_safety": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding safety assessment indicated potential concerns with bolus control and minor gagging episodes. Specific considerations include close monitoring for aspiration risk, though overt signs of aspiration were not observed during the assessment. These findings suggest a need for ongoing safety monitoring and potentially modifying feeding techniques to ensure safety."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding efficiency evaluation demonstrated variable timing and coordination during meals, indicating emerging feeding competence that requires support. The child's ability to manage various textures is inconsistent, with transitional textures posing some challenges."
