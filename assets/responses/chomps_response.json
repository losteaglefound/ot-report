"**Pediatric Occupational Therapy Evaluation Report: ChOMPS Assessment Interpretation**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: [Patient Name]\n- Date of Birth: [DOB]\n- Date of Assessment: [Assessment Date]\n- Evaluator: [Evaluator Name], OTR/L\n\n**Assessment Tool:**\n- Child Oral and Motor Proficiency Scale (ChOMPS)\n\n**Domain-Specific Scores and Levels of Concern:**\n\nUpon administration of the ChOMPS assessment, the following domain-specific scores were obtained:\n\n1. **Oral Motor Skills:**\n   - Score: [Score]\n   - Level of Concern: [Level of Concern]\n   - Interpretation: The child demonstrates [describe specific oral motor skills, e.g., reduced tongue lateralization, limited jaw stability], indicating [mild/moderate/severe] concern in this domain.\n\n2. **Swallowing Efficiency:**\n   - Score: [Score]\n   - Level of Concern: [Level of Concern]\n   - Interpretation: Observations reveal [e.g., delayed swallow initiation, reduced bolus propulsion], suggesting [mild/moderate/severe] concern for efficient swallowing.\n\n3. **Sensory Processing:**\n   - Score: [Score]\n   - Level of Concern: [Level of Concern]\n   - Interpretation: The child exhibits [e.g., hypersensitivity to textures, aversion to certain food consistencies], indicating [mild/moderate/severe] concern in sensory processing related to feeding.\n\n**Feeding Risks:**\n\n1. **Bolus Control:**\n   - The child exhibits [e.g., inconsistent bolus formation, premature spillage], posing a risk for inefficient oral transit and potential aspiration.\n\n2. **Gagging:**\n   - Frequent gagging episodes were noted, particularly with [specific textures or consistencies], indicating a heightened sensitivity and potential risk for aspiration.\n\n3. **Food Hoarding:**\n   - The child demonstrates a tendency to hoard food in the buccal cavities, which may lead to prolonged oral phase and increased risk of choking.\n\n**Safety Considerations and Aspiration Risk Assessment:**\n\n- The child presents with [describe any specific signs of aspiration risk, e.g., coughing during meals, wet vocal quality post-swallow], necessitating close monitoring during feeding to mitigate the risk of aspiration.\n\n**Clinical Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Texture Modification:**\n   - Implement a [e.g., pureed, mechanical soft] diet to facilitate safer and more efficient swallowing. Gradual introduction of more challenging textures should be considered as oral motor skills improve.\n\n2. **Feeding Strategies:**\n   - Encourage small, manageable bites and sips to enhance bolus control. Utilize pacing techniques to prevent fatigue and ensure safe swallowing.\n\n3. **Caregiver Education:**\n   - Educate caregivers on recognizing signs of aspiration and appropriate responses. Provide training on safe feeding techniques and the importance of maintaining an upright posture during meals.\n\n4. **Therapeutic Interventions:**\n   - Initiate a targeted oral motor therapy program focusing on strengthening jaw stability, improving tongue lateralization, and enhancing sensory tolerance to varied textures.\n\n5. **Regular Monitoring:**\n   - Conduct follow-up assessments to monitor progress and adjust intervention strategies as necessary.\n\n**Functional Feeding Abilities:**\n\nThe findings from the ChOMPS assessment indicate that the child's current feeding abilities are compromised by [specific issues, e.g., poor bolus control, sensory aversions], impacting overall feeding safety and efficiency. The recommended interventions aim to address these deficits, promoting improved functional feeding outcomes and reducing the risk of aspiration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ChOMPS assessment has provided valuable insights into the child's feeding challenges, highlighting specific areas of concern that require targeted intervention. Through a combination of texture modification, caregiver education, and therapeutic exercises, the goal is to enhance the child's feeding safety and efficiency, ultimately supporting their nutritional intake and overall well-being.\n\n**Evaluator Signature:**\n- [Evaluator Name], OTR/L\n- [Date]"
