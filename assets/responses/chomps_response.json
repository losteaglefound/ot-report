    "domain_analysis": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Analysis of ChOMPS domains revealed moderate levels of concern in bolus control and food hoarding, and mild levels of concern in gagging patterns. The assessment identified these areas as requiring targeted intervention to enhance feeding safety and efficiency."
    },
    "feeding_safety": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding safety assessment indicated significant concerns regarding bolus control and a moderate risk of aspiration due to occasional coughing during meals. Gagging patterns were mild but recurrent, suggesting a need for monitoring. These findings suggest implementing safety modifications and careful monitoring during feeding sessions."

    "feeding_efficiency": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding efficiency evaluation demonstrated inconsistent timing and coordination during mealtimes. The child's ability to manage both solid and liquid textures shows delayed responsiveness and delayed swallowing reflexes, indicating the need for structured feeding interventions focused on improving coordination and efficiency."
