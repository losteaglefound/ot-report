        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The ChOMPS assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing function across multiple domains to identify feeding difficulties and safety concerns. This assessment provides critical information for developing feeding intervention strategies."

    "domain_analysis": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Analysis of ChOMPS domains revealed mild to moderate concerns regarding feeding safety and efficiency, particularly in bolus formation and oral transit. The assessment identified significant concern in the oral-motor domain, noting difficulties in maintaining bolus integrity and premature spillage, necessitating targeted intervention."
    },
    "feeding_safety": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding safety assessment indicated moderate safety concerns. Specific considerations include inconsistent bolus control leading to potential aspiration risk and occasional coughing episodes, which suggest the need for vigilant monitoring during oral intake and potential referral for further instrumental evaluation if persistent."
    },
    "feeding_efficiency": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding efficiency evaluation demonstrated delayed timing in oral manipulation and reduced coordination, impacting the child's feeding competence. The child's capacity to manage mixed textures reveals a need for gradual texture progression to enhance feeding efficiency while ensuring safety."
