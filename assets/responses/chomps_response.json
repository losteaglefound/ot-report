"**Clinical Evaluation Report: ChOMPS Assessment Interpretation**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: [Patient Name]\n- Age: [Patient Age]\n- Date of Assessment: [Date]\n- Evaluator: [Evaluator Name]\n\n**Assessment Tool:**\n- ChOMPS (Child Oral and Motor Proficiency Scale)\n\n**Domain-Specific Scores and Levels of Concern:**\n\nThe ChOMPS assessment revealed the following domain-specific scores and associated levels of concern:\n\n1. **Oral Motor Skills:**\n   - Score: [Score]\n   - Level of Concern: Moderate\n   - Interpretation: The patient demonstrates moderate deficits in oral motor skills, particularly in the areas of lip closure and tongue lateralization, which are critical for effective bolus formation and manipulation.\n\n2. **Sensory Processing:**\n   - Score: [Score]\n   - Level of Concern: Mild\n   - Interpretation: Mild sensory processing difficulties were noted, with the patient exhibiting some aversions to certain textures, which may impact food acceptance and variety.\n\n3. **Feeding Efficiency:**\n   - Score: [Score]\n   - Level of Concern: Significant\n   - Interpretation: Significant concerns were observed in feeding efficiency, characterized by prolonged meal times and fatigue during feeding sessions.\n\n**Feeding Risks:**\n\n- **Bolus Control:** The patient exhibits compromised bolus control, with frequent anterior spillage and difficulty maintaining a cohesive bolus, increasing the risk of aspiration.\n- **Gagging:** Occasional gagging was observed, particularly with mixed textures, indicating potential hypersensitivity or delayed oral transit time.\n- **Food Hoarding:** The patient demonstrates a tendency to hoard food in the buccal cavities, which may lead to inefficient mastication and increased risk of choking.\n\n**Safety Considerations and Aspiration Risk Assessment:**\n\nThe assessment indicates a moderate risk of aspiration due to inadequate bolus control and delayed swallow initiation. Close monitoring during feeding is recommended to ensure safety and prevent aspiration-related complications.\n\n**Clinical Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Texture Modification:**\n   - Transition to soft, cohesive textures to facilitate safer swallowing and improve bolus control. Gradual introduction of mixed textures should be considered as oral motor skills improve.\n\n2. **Feeding Strategies:**\n   - Implement paced feeding techniques to manage fatigue and enhance feeding efficiency. Encourage small, manageable bites to reduce the risk of aspiration.\n\n3. **Oral Motor Exercises:**\n   - Engage in targeted oral motor exercises to strengthen lip closure, improve tongue lateralization, and enhance overall oral motor coordination.\n\n4. **Caregiver Education:**\n   - Educate caregivers on safe feeding practices, including appropriate positioning during meals and signs of aspiration. Provide training on how to implement recommended feeding strategies and texture modifications at home.\n\n5. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:**\n   - Collaborate with a speech-language pathologist for a comprehensive dysphagia evaluation and to address any underlying swallowing disorders.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ChOMPS assessment highlights significant concerns in the patient's feeding safety and efficiency, necessitating immediate intervention. The outlined clinical recommendations aim to enhance the patient's functional feeding abilities, ensuring a safer and more effective feeding experience. Continued monitoring and adaptation of the intervention plan will be essential to address evolving needs and promote optimal feeding outcomes.\n\n**Follow-Up:**\n- Schedule follow-up assessment in [Time Frame] to evaluate progress and adjust the intervention plan as necessary.\n\n**Evaluator Signature:**\n- [Evaluator Name]\n- [Evaluator Credentials]\n- [Date]"
