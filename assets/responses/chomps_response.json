    "domain_analysis": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Analysis of ChOMPS domains revealed moderate concerns in the domains of bolus control and oral-motor coordination. The assessment identified high levels of concern in aspiration risk due to observable coughing and choking episodes during intake, which require intervention attention."

    "feeding_safety": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding safety assessment indicated significant safety concerns related to bolus control and aspiration risk. Specific considerations include poor bolus control and frequent gagging, suggesting a high aspiration risk. These findings suggest vigilant monitoring during feeding and the need for safety strategies to mitigate choking hazards."

    "feeding_efficiency": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding efficiency evaluation demonstrated extended meal durations and insufficient chewing, impacting the overall feeding competence. The child's ability to manage varied textures shows difficulty, indicating inefficiency with solids, requiring modifications to promote nutritional intake."
