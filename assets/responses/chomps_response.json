        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The ChOMPS assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing function across multiple domains to identify feeding difficulties and safety concerns. This assessment provides critical information for developing feeding intervention strategies."
    },
    "domain_analysis": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Analysis of ChOMPS domains revealed moderate concerns regarding feeding safety and efficiency, particularly in the domains of oral motor skills and bolus management. The assessment identified a significant level of concern in bolus control and pacing during oral intake, which require intervention attention."
    },
    "feeding_safety": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding safety assessment indicated concerns with bolus control, particularly with textured and lumped foods, increasing the risk of aspiration. Specific considerations include occasional gagging and signs of food hoarding within the cheeks, suggesting a need for vigilant monitoring and potential safety precautions during feeding activities."
    },
    "feeding_efficiency": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding efficiency evaluation demonstrated prolonged meal durations and compromised coordination, especially with foods requiring mastication. The child's ability to manage various textures is inconsistent, displaying difficulties with adequately forming a cohesive bolus. This inefficiency affects overall nutritional intake and feeding independence."

        "content": "Based on ChOMPS findings, intervention priorities focus on improving bolus control, enhancing oral motor skills, and ensuring safe swallowing through appropriate texture modifications. Regular reassessment will be important to monitor feeding development and adjust intervention strategies as needed."
