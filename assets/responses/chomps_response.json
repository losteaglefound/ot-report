    "domain_analysis": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Analysis of ChOMPS domains revealed moderate concern regarding feeding safety and efficiency. The assessment identified a high level of concern in bolus formation and control domains that require intervention attention."

    "feeding_safety": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding safety assessment indicated concerns with bolus control and a moderate risk for aspiration due to poor oral motor coordination. Specific considerations include frequent episodes of gagging and some instances of food hoarding. These findings suggest close monitoring during meals and implementation of safe swallowing strategies."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding efficiency evaluation demonstrated challenges with timing and coordination, indicating reduced overall feeding competence. The child's ability to manage a range of textures shows variability, necessitating targeted intervention to improve efficiency and safety."
