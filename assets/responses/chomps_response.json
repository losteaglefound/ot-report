        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The ChOMPS assessment evaluates feeding and swallowing function across multiple domains to identify feeding difficulties and safety concerns. This assessment provides critical information for developing feeding intervention strategies."

    "domain_analysis": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Analysis of ChOMPS domains revealed increased levels of concern in the areas of bolus control, timely swallowing initiation, and texture management. The assessment identified moderate concern requiring intervention attention in these domains to prevent risk and improve feeding efficiency."

    "feeding_safety": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding safety assessment indicated notable concerns related to bolus control and potential aspiration risks. Specific considerations include inconsistent bolus formation and delayed swallowing reflex, increasing the risk for aspiration and choking episodes. These findings suggest the need for close monitoring and implementation of safety precautions during feeding."

    "feeding_efficiency": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Feeding efficiency evaluation demonstrated challenges in coordinating breathing and swallowing, impacting overall feeding competence. The child exhibited difficulty managing mixed textures, which implicates compromised efficiency and requires ongoing assessment and intervention support."
