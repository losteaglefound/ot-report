    "cognitive_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "In the Cognitive domain, Sabrina achieved a scaled score that falls within the average range for her age. This places her in the 50th percentile, indicating typical performance relative to her peers. Performance in this domain reflects the child's ability to problem-solve, explore the environment, and demonstrate early learning skills. Specific tasks included object exploration and cause-effect problem solving, in which Sabrina demonstrated age-appropriate skills."

    "language_domains": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Language assessment revealed that Sabrina's receptive communication skills are within the average range as per age-expected norms. She successfully demonstrated understanding of simple words and gestures. Her expressive communication is also consistent with age expectations, as she effectively uses vocalizations and babbling. These results indicate Sabrina is on target for her language comprehension and verbal expression, aligning well with developmental expectations for 10-month-olds."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Motor evaluation demonstrated that Sabrina's fine motor skills are within the average range, as observed through tasks requiring manipulation of objects and basic hand-eye coordination. Her gross motor abilities, including crawling and sitting, were also average, aligning with typical development milestones for her age. These scores reflect the child's ability to coordinate movements and manipulate objects in the environment effectively."
