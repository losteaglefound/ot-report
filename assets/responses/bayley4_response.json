        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The Bayley-4 assessment was administered to evaluate Sabrina's developmental functioning across cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior domains. The assessment provides standardized scores that allow comparison to same-age peers and identification of areas of strength and need."

    "cognitive_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "In the Cognitive domain, Sabrina achieved a scaled score that falls within the average range (50th percentile), indicating typical cognitive development for her chronological age. Performance in this domain reflects the child's ability to problem-solve, explore the environment, and demonstrate early learning skills, which are aligned with expectations for her age group."
