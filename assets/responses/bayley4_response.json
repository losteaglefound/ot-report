        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "In the Cognitive domain, Sabrina achieved a scaled score of 5, classified as Below Average, placing her within the 9th to 24th percentile. This performance suggests mild cognitive challenges that may impact problem-solving and learning. She exhibits delays compared to her chronological age peers, necessitating intervention to support cognitive development."
