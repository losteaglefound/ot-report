        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The Bayley-4 assessment was administered to evaluate Sabrina's developmental functioning across cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior domains. The assessment provides standardized scores that allow comparison to same-age peers and identification of areas of strength and need."
    },
    "cognitive_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "In the Cognitive domain, Sabrina achieved a scaled score that falls within the average range (50th percentile), indicating age-appropriate cognitive processing skills. Performance in this domain reflects the child's ability to problem-solve, explore the environment, and demonstrate early learning skills typical for her age."
    },
    "language_domains": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Language assessment revealed receptive communication findings falling in the below average range, with a scaled score placing her in the 25th percentile, and expressive communication findings in the average range at the 55th percentile. These results indicate that Sabrina's receptive language skills are slightly delayed compared to her peers, while her expressive language skills are age-appropriate, reflecting a need for enhanced support in understanding and processing spoken language."
    },
    "motor_domains": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Motor evaluation demonstrated fine motor findings within the below average range, with a scaled score at the 30th percentile, and gross motor findings in the average range at the 60th percentile. These scores reflect Sabrina's relative strengths in gross motor development, such as crawling and sitting, while indicating a need for intervention to enhance her ability in tasks requiring hand-eye coordination and manipulation of small objects."
    },
    "social_emotional_adaptive": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Social-emotional and adaptive behavior assessments indicated scaled scores within the average range, which reflects Sabrina's age-appropriate capability to interact with others, regulate emotions, and demonstrate self-care skills congruent with developmental expectations."

        "content": [
            "Strengths in gross motor skills can be leveraged to support further development in other areas.",
            "Receptive language and fine motor skills show potential areas for focused intervention.",
            "Moderate delays in receptive communication may impact Sabrina's ability to follow instructions, necessitating targeted language interventions.",
            "Recommendations include family education on strategies to promote language and fine motor development, collaboration with early intervention services, and use of play as a vehicle for skill acquisition."
