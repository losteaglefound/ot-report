    "assessment_summary": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The Bayley-4 assessment was administered to evaluate Sabrina's developmental functioning across cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior domains. The assessment provides standardized scores that allow comparison to same-age peers and identification of areas of strength and need."
    },
    "cognitive_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "In the Cognitive domain, Sabrina achieved a scaled score that falls within the average range (50th percentile), indicating typical development for her chronological age. Performance in this domain reflects the child's ability to problem-solve, explore the environment, and demonstrate early learning skills consistent with age expectations."
    },
    "language_domains": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Language assessment revealed that Sabrina's receptive communication is within the below average range, with difficulties observed in following simple commands. Her expressive communication is within the average range, as she can vocalize basic sounds and engage in early babbling. These results indicate that while her verbal expression aligns with developmental expectations, her comprehension of language may require additional support."
    },
    "motor_domains": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Motor evaluation demonstrated fine motor skills in the average range, with Sabrina able to grasp and manipulate small toys effectively. However, gross motor skills are within the below average range, with noted difficulties in crawling and standing with support. These scores reflect the child's ability to coordinate movements and manipulate objects in the environment, with fine motor skills being a relative strength."

    "social_emotional_adaptive": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Social-emotional and adaptive behavior assessment indicated that Sabrina is developing in a manner consistent with her peers. She demonstrates appropriate responses to social interactions and is beginning to regulate emotions adequately. Her adaptive behaviors in self-feeding and basic play are developing as expected for her age."

            "Sabrina's fine motor skills can be leveraged as a strength for building intervention strategies.",
            "Targeted support is needed in gross motor and receptive language domains to promote age-appropriate development.",
            "Functional implications include enhancement of Sabrina's mobility and comprehension to support her in daily activities.",
            "Recommendations include increasing opportunities for Sabrina to engage in social interactions and structured play to enhance receptive language skills, and motor activities designed to promote gross motor development."
