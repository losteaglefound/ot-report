        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "The Bayley-4 assessment was administered to evaluate Sabrina's developmental functioning across cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior domains. The assessment provides standardized scores that allow comparison to same-age peers and identification of areas of strength and need."

    "cognitive_domain": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "In the Cognitive domain, Sabrina achieved a scaled score of 4, classified as Below Average, placing her within the 9th to 24th percentile. This indicates that Sabrina experiences mild challenges in problem-solving and cognitive processing, which may impact her early learning opportunities and interactions within her environment. During the evaluation, Sabrina demonstrated difficulty in engaging consistently in play activities that required sustained attention and exploration."
    },
    "language_domains": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Language assessment revealed that Sabrina's receptive communication scaled score is 4 (Below Average), and expressive communication scaled score is 1 (Extremely Low). These results suggest that Sabrina faces mild difficulties in understanding spoken language and following complex instructions, compounded by severe expressive language delays that significantly hinder her ability to verbally express needs and desires. Intensive speech therapy intervention is recommended to address these challenges and support her in meeting developmental milestones."
    },
    "motor_domains": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Motor evaluation demonstrated that Sabrina has achieved scaled scores of 4 in both fine and gross motor domains, classified as Below Average (9th to 24th percentile). These scores reflect mild fine motor delays impacting Sabrina's ability to perform self-care skills, such as grasping small objects, and slight gross motor delays affecting her mobility and engagement in play activities. Encouragement of motor play and exploration can facilitate improvement in these areas."

    "social_emotional_adaptive": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "Social-emotional and adaptive behavior assessment data is not fully available but generally reflects the child's ability to interact with others, regulate emotions, and demonstrate age-appropriate self-care skills. Further assessment is recommended for a comprehensive understanding."

        "content": [
            "Areas of strength can provide a foundation for building intervention strategies focused on enhancing cognitive and motor skills.",
            "Specific domains such as expressive communication and motor functioning require targeted intervention support to aid in developmental improvement.",
            "Functional implications include potential challenges in daily activities such as communication, play participation, and mobility that must be addressed with a multidisciplinary approach.",
            "Recommendations include initiating speech and occupational therapy and incorporating targeted activities for language and motor development for the family and intervention team."
