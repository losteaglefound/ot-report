Specifically, he observed that Sabrina has difficulty maintaining attention during play activities, often becoming distracted and losing interest quickly. He also mentioned concerns about Sabrina's fine motor skills, noting challenges with grasping and manipulating small objects. Furthermore, James is worried about Sabrina's speech and language development, as he notices that she struggles with babbling and does not respond consistently when her name is called. Additionally, Sabrina seems to have difficulty with transitions, becoming noticeably upset when preferred items, such as toys, are removed. These observations cause James to worry about her ability to social interact and meet developmental milestones effectively."
