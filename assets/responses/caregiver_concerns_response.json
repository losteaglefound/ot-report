        "content": "James expressed concerns regarding Sabrina's overall development, particularly noting difficulties with attention and focus. Sabrina seems unable to sustain attention on toys or activities suitable for her age, often becoming distracted quickly. Furthermore, James has observed that Sabrina struggles with age-appropriate fine motor tasks, such as grasping small objects and manipulating toys, which may impact milestones typically achieved by her peers. In terms of speech and language development, James is concerned about Sabrina's limited vocalizations and apparent frustration when trying to communicate needs. Additionally, James described that Sabrina often gets upset during transitions, especially when preferred activities or items are removed, suggesting challenges in behavioral regulation. These observations, coupled with concerns about her interaction with other children, underscore the need for a comprehensive developmental assessment."
