2. Language Scale:
• Receptive Language: Evaluates the child's understanding of words, gestures, and simple instructions.
• Expressive Language: Measures verbal communication, including babbling, single words, and early sentence formation.

3. Motor Scale:
• Fine Motor: Examines grasping, manipulation of objects, hand-eye coordination, and early writing skills.
• Gross Motor: Evaluates posture, crawling, standing, balance, and walking patterns.

4. Social-Emotional Scale: Measures the child's ability to interact with others, regulate emotions, and respond to social cues.
